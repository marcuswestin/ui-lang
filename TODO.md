# TODO

## ui-lang

- [ ] Make everything work
- [ ] Start stubbing out tao-lang examples
  - [x] Create some tests for the examples
  - [ ] Authentication
    - [ ] Model out what RPC calls require auth?
      - Nah - this should be on the server side.
      - Errors! When not authenticated, that's a special kind of error
  - [ ] error handling
    - [ ] zig has some great features here
    - [ ] make it an error not to handle async state loading in-progress/errors
    - [ ] Different kinds of errors
      - Auth errors, Invalid input, Missing data, Unexpected/Server error, Network errors (timeouts, etc)
      - Taking a long time to load notification!
  - [ ] Notifications
    - Yellow/warnings: loading taking a long time
    - Expected errors: Timeout, incorrect username/password
  - [ ] Views
    - [ ] Registering interaction pattern handlers
      - Click, gestures, tap, drag, long press,
      - Camera input gestures, touchpad
    - [ ] Themes
      - // see theme-exploration.ui
      - [ ] Making theme property values available everywhere with type-safety, without having to specify a theme type definition. AppTheme + specifying theme variations for specific view hierarchies if wanted
      - [ ] Spacing: TODO
      - [ ] Text: Make all text views require specifying the typography used
  - [ ] State
    - [ ] async state
      - fetchers, loading state, fetch error state
    - [ ] State methods.
      - [ ] Research: How do different languages do this?
      - classes? structs with methods?
      - object interfaces? protocols?
  - [ ] Handlers
- [x] Create a basic parser using Lezer https://lezer.codemirror.net
  - [x] Read this: https://marijnhaverbeke.nl/blog/lezer.html
- [ ] Consider different UI previews
  - [ ] Previewing the code itself: https://youtu.be/5V1ynVyud4M?si=SOO3ChFxdn6FnX_i&t=942
  - [ ] Create syntax for creating a Preview with a given state
  - [ ] Consider how we can have multiple views onto the same code, with different purposes. One might fold all styling, another might display only event handlers; a third might display only the view in consideration.
- [ ] Research Error handling

    - [x] Intro
    - [x] Lazy layouts
    - [x] Material You, latest version, Compose Material
      - Theming, different color contrast needs, more
      - Display L, Display M, Display S
      - [ ] Colors
        - Primary, Secondary, Tertiary, Error and Neutral; Background, SurfaceVariant
          - onPrimary, onSecondary, onTertiary, onError, onNeutral, onBackground, onSurfaceVariant,
          - primaryContainer, ..., surface, outline
      - [ ] Fonts
        - Based on USE and SIZE
      - [ ] Shapes
        - Rounded corner: none, extra small, small, medium, large, extra large
      - [ ] Look at the theme builder:
        - https://m3.material.io/blog/material-theme-builder
      - [ ] Dynamic color!
        - Basically, a color scheme that is generated from a background wallpaper
      - [ ] Common navigation elements
        - Top Bar: TopAppBar, CenterAlignedTopAppBar, Medium, Large
        - Bottom: NavigationBar, NavigationRail, ModalNavigationDrawer, DismissableModalNavigationDrawer, PermanentNavigationDrawer
      - [ ] KEY! Layout changes based on screen size
        - It's important to consider Navigation in larger screens
        - Is this something that is done in the APP LANG layer, or something that's built as views on top of it?
